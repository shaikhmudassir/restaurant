## Problem statement
Design an admin-template-based Django search application that can search through the names of dishes and recommend the best match for the same.

## Installation

   ```
4. Migrations

   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## My Words
My implementation focuses on the fundamental nature of the problem, which is a search application for dishes. Although the problem statement was brief, I have utilized my Django skills to create a functional and efficient application. 
Based on your expectations, I'm happy to explore further enhancements within my one-day lead time. Please let me know if you have any specific areas you'd like me to focus on.
