# Primenumbers Technologies Assignment

## Problem statement
Design an admin-template-based Django search application that can search through the names of dishes and recommend the best match for the same.

## Installation 
1. Clone this repository
2. Activate virtual environment
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install Libraries
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Migrations
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
5. Import the CSV data into the Database (if db.sqlite3 already exists then ignore this step)
   ```
   python import_csv.py
   ```
6. Run Server
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## My Words
Thank you for considering me for the Primenumbers Technologies Assignment. I have designed a Django search application that can search through the names of dishes and recommend the best match for the user. 

To install the application, please follow the simple steps below:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Activate the virtual environment using the commands provided below:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the necessary libraries with the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the necessary migrations with the following commands:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Import the CSV data into the database using the command below:

```
python import_csv.py
```

(Note: If db.sqlite3 already exists, you can skip this step.)

6. Run the server with the following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

My implementation focuses on the fundamental nature of the problem, which is a search application for dishes. Although the problem statement was brief, I have utilized my Django skills to create a functional and efficient application. 
Based on your expectations, I'm happy to explore further enhancements within my one-day lead time. Please let me know if you have any specific areas you'd like me to focus on.
